# Memory-game
classic memory game in java

Game is about finding identical pairs of cards. Player chooses 2 cards
and turns them face up. If cards are identical, they stay faced up, if not they will be turned face down (after 2
seconds or after choosing new card). The game ends when the last pair is faced up. After running a program
menu should appear. It contains three options:
• new game
• high scores
• exit 

After running a new game player will be asked in a separated window what size of a board he wants. Remember
that number of cards has to be even (e.g. size can’t be 3x3).  

When a game starts in a new window should be a board with cards faced down and a timer runs.

After finishing a game in new window, a player will be asked to type a nick which will be used in high scores
board. Score is calculated based on time and size of a board (e.g. points=size of a board / time).
Scoreboard has to be saved in a file, so the data will be permanent.
